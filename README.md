# student-grades
This simple PHP program takes input of student names and prints their grades.

If you read the code, there are 3 students: susan, max and julia.

enter one of the names and their grade will be shown. Entering names not present in the array will print "undefined array key" error :)

TO RUN THE PROGRAM,
you need to have php installed in your system and then set up a local server. Surf the web to see how to view PHP files in a browser.
